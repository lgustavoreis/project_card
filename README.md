Activity 1: Product Page with Cards
Objective: Create a page displaying a list of products in card format.
Description:
Create a products.html file that displays a title "Our Products" and a grid of product cards.
Each product should be represented by a card containing an image, title, and price.
Use SCSS to style the cards, ensuring they are responsive (2 per row on small screens and 4 per row on large screens).
In the products.js file, add an event that displays an alert with the product name when any card is clicked.
Directories:
HTML: products.html
SCSS: products.scss
JS: products.js
